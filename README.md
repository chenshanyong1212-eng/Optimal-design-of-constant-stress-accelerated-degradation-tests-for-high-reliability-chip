# Optimal-design-of-constant-stress-accelerated-degradation-tests-for-high-reliability-chip
A degradation model is established based on Wiener stochastic process. Then, a new model parameter estimation method is proposed based on Bayesian theory and KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence formula.
There are two Python files: Traditional_Parameter_Estimation_Method.py and Estimation_Methods_Based_on_Bayesian.py, as well as Estimation_Methods_Based_on_Bi-objective.py. The file Traditional_Parameter_Estimation_Method.py implements traditional parameter estimation methods along with Bayesian-based approaches. This code generates a CSV file containing the estimated mean and variance results for parameters a and b from both methodologies. The file Estimation_Methods_Based_on_Bi-objective.py implements bi-objective optimization-based parameter estimation methods. Similarly, this code produces a CSV file documenting the estimated mean and variance values for parameters a and b obtained through this approach.
